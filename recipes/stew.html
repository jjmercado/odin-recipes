    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>600g pork shoulder (in one piece)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>A little black pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>6 mushrooms</li>
        <li>1/2 onion (100g)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salad oil</li>
        <li>20g butter</li>
        <li>25g low protein flour</li>
        <li>400ml red wine</li>
        <li>400ml chicken broth</li>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut pork into 1.5cm thick slices, place in a bowl and sprinkle with salt, pepper and flour. Cut the garlic clove in the middle, take out the germ and then crush it with the kitchen knife. Halve the mushrooms and cut the onion into sticks.</li>
        <li>Put salad oil in a saucepan, add garlic and turn stove to medium heat. When the garlic starts to become fragrant, remove and add butter (10g) to the pot. Once melted, add the meat to the pot along with the flour from the bowl and brown on both sides until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Pour red wine, bring to a boil so that the alcohol evaporates, then add chicken broth, garlic from (2) and bay leaves. Bring to a boil again, skim off foam if it forms, and remove bay leaves. Add raisins and ketchup, tilt the lid and simmer on low heat for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add butter (10g) to a heated pan. When it starts to melt, add mushrooms and onion, saut√© and then add to the meat in the pot. Cook for another 20 minutes. If necessary, season with salt (not indicated in the ingredients).</li>
